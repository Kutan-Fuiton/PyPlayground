# PyPlayground üêçüé™

Welcome to the **PyPlayground**! This is a collection of fun, beginner-friendly Python projects designed to make learning the fundamentals of programming an interactive and enjoyable experience. Forget boring tutorials; here, we learn by building cool stuff!

## üéØ What's This All About?

This repository is my personal space for exploring Python basics through small projects. Each project focuses on a few key programming concepts, like variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and working with popular libraries. Whether you're a complete beginner or just looking for some fun ideas, you're in the right place!

## üöÄ Projects

Here's a list of the projects you'll find here. They are roughly ordered from simplest to more complex.

| Project Name | Description | Key Concepts Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Calculator CLI** | A CLI-based scientific calculator with direct expression evaluation and matrix operations. | NumPy arrays, function definitions, error handling, CLI input parsing, matrix operations |
| **Tic Tac Toe** | A classic two-player grid game where players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 board. | list manipulation, while loops, conditional logic (if/elif/else), user input handling, string formatting, game state validation |
| *[More Coming Soon!]* | | |
